          | The Science Lab Projects are a curated list of open source software projects helping further science on the web.
          | This is a pilot study testing out new ways help the Science Lab community work together on code projects. Over the next several months we will be open for community contirbutions. We hope that this will help us learn how to best help the research community contribute to software for science.

        h2 History
        p
          | This program was first
          a(href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hIs1fWumaXU")  announced
          |  as "Interdisciplinary Programming" by Angelina Fabbro (
          a(href="https://twitter.com/hopefulcyborg") @hopefulcyborg
          | ) and Bill Mills (
          a(href="https://twitter.com/billdoesphysics") @billdoesphysics
          | ) at
          a(href="https://thestrangeloop.com/")  Stange Loop
          |  and
          a(href="http://2013.lxjs.org/")  LXJS
          |  in 2013. Since then, it has evolved into the Mozilla Science Lab's pilot on contributorship - we're hoping to build on this program and learn about how our whole community can work together! You can read the
          a(href="http://mozillascience.org/bringing-researchers-and-developers-together-a-call-for-proposals/")  original call for proposals here
          | .

        h2(id='FAQ') FAQ
        b Do I have to be a scientist to help?
        p No! We've tried to tease out tasks that are specially suited for designers, developers and contributors with no knowledge of the relevant science. If you have questions about the science involved, the project leads and the MSL team would be happy to try and sort them out - but all that's required is enthusiasm!

        b Can I submit my project?
        p Unfortunately, the call for proposals has closed for this pilot study. We will be looking for new projects soon, though!

        b How can I help?
        p When you find a project you're interested in, just click the 'Join Project!' button to begin. The project lead will be notified and you can work together to see where your skills can help the project.
